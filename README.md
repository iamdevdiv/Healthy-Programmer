# Healthy Programmer

A programmer must be healthy. 'Healthy Programmer' will help you stay fit and fine.  

Drinking a lot of water and physical exercise is very important for everyone to maintain their health. One of the major problems of programmers is that they do not move from their seats once they start coding. Healthy Programmer will solve this problem. It will regularly remind you to drink water, rest your eyes and do physical exercise by showing you a console window, and it will also play a sound. This will not only make you healthy but also increase your productivity.

## Installation

Just download and run **setup.exe** to install Healthy Programmer on your system. Once installed, this program will be added to your system's Startup items to make it run automatically on every system boot. No need to restart your computer after installation; the program will start automatically. Use the *Ctrl+Alt+Z* shortcut to reveal the console window of Healthy Programmer.

## Usage
Healthy Programmer will run in the background. The console window for this program will be hidden but can be revealed using the *Ctrl+Alt+Z* shortcut. Using the console window, you can run commands to get information about the next reminders, change clock format, stop/kill the program, etc.  
This program will also keep records when you perform some activity given by it. You can view those records using the console window of this program.  
**When you login onto your system, you may see a console window pop-up which disappears suddenly. You can ignore it. It is the just the startup of Healthy Programmer.**

**Note:** On stopping, the program will not give you any reminders, but it will keep running in the background. You can restart the program after stopping. But after killing it, the program will be terminated completely, including the console window. It will restart on the next system bootup.
